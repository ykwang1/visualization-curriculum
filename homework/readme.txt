Having grown up in the Pacific Northwest, I found that the endless cloudy days and lack of sunshine, particularly in the winter, to be quite depressing. I hoped to use this dataset to compare how much sunshine different locations in the United States receive by month, when compared to Seattle. In order to quickly demonstrate the relative cloudiness of Seattle, I calculated the ratio of the average hours of sunshine in X city to the average hours of sunshine in Seattle. Visualizing this (ratio) quantity over the course of a year is the key to answering my question, so I decided to make a line plot, encoding an ordinal time-related variable "month", as well as my calculated ratio with the x and y position dimensions, respectively. Since the position dimensions handle can effectively visualize the relations between nominal (N), ordinal (O), and quantity (Q) variables, it made sense to use these as the primary dimensions to encode the two most important variables, Month (O) and Sunshine Ratio (Q).

In order to present this information clearly for all cities, I had to decide whether to overlay all of the lines, each line representing the sunshine in X city/sunshine in Seattle ratio, in the same plot, or whether to create one line plot for each city. I chose the latter, finding it easier to comprehend the visualization with each city separate. Since my main question involves comparing each city to Seattle, and not to each other, I don't gain as much from overlaying all the lines on the same plot, since the main advantage of doing so is the ease of comparing different cities to one another. However, I did arrange the 6 subplots in a 2x3 grid according the relative geographical position, with Seattle in the upper left and Miami in the lower right. This gives position (of the subplots) a second encoding: the ordinality of the longitude and latitude of the cities. Lastly, I decided to plot the baseline in each plot. If the calculated sunshine ratio is above the baseline (i.e. 1), the city on average receives more sunshine than Seattle. We can see immediately that especially in the months of Nov- Jan, almost every other city receives twice as many hours of sunshine for every hour of sunshine Seattle receives. We also see this is most pronounced in the southernmost cities, such as Miami and Houston--meaning the secondary position encoding does contribute to the overall visualization.

The choices of the visual elements were also deliberate. The color dimension allows the viewer to quickly distinguish between the baseline and the sunshine ratio. I chose orange to represent the sunshine ratio due to its association with the sun, and green as the baseline color due to Seattle being the "Emerald City" (also because it's visually distinct from orange--although this could be an issue for colorblind viewers). I further added dots to each data point to emphasize the ordinal nature of the x-axis variable, and also so that the values can be quickly looked up for each month. I also overlay a grid to help read the values of the points as well, using a white grid on the blue background for minimum intrusiveness. The legend at the bottom serves as a caption of sorts, where the quantities can by explained in further detail. And since the y-position encoding is a ratio quantity, it makes sense to start the y-axis at 0, so the relative heights represent relative values.

Lastly, since Seattle is further north than all the other cities in this sample, it may be misleading to assume that the lack of sunshine in winter months is completely due to cloud cover--it could partly also be due to fewer daylight hours in general. Using the latitude of each city and some spherical trigonometry, I can calculate the number of daylight hours in each day, and aggregate these values by month to get the total daylight hours. I decided then to plot the ratio of total daylight hours per month (i.e. the maximum possible hours of sunshine) to average hours of sunshine per month in Seattle. This quantity carries a TON of new information: users can deduce the pct of daylight hours with sunshine in each month and the ratio of total daylight hours between locations. However, I struggled with whether to include this quantity in my visualization, since not all this information is directly relevant to my question, and interpreting this quantity takes more expanation. I decided that since cloud cover was such a motivating factor for my question, this quantity adds value to my visualization. I include this second ratio as a light grey line in each plot, hoping that viewers will first gravitate toward the brighter colored elements. By looking at the relative heights of the orange and grey lines, we are viewing the relative sunshine to total daylight: e.g. for Seattle in December, only 1 out of 5 daylight hours is sunshine. Compare this 20% sunshine:daylight ratio in Seattle to the roughly 4 sunshine hours per 6.2 daylight hours (65%) in Miami in December! We also see that while Seattle sees less daylight than Miami in December (at a 5:6.2 ratio), the majority of this difference in sunshine must be because Seattle is so overcast!
